# Fails the build when SonarCloud reports an unresolved issue on a pull
# request's new code.
#
# Why a script rather than a Quality Gate condition: our SonarCloud plan cannot
# associate anything but the built-in "Sonar way" gate, and that gate's
# conditions only look at ratings, coverage and duplication — never at the issue
# count, which is why hundreds of open issues still show up green. This stands in
# for the `new_violations = 0` condition we are not allowed to configure.
#
# The project is public, so every endpoint read here needs no token.
